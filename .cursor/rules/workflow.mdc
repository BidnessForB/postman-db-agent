# Development Workflow & Planning Rules

## Critical Workflow Requirements
- NEVER create or modify code without creating a plan first and confirming it with me
- Other actions like web searches you can perform without confirmation
- Break down complex tasks into clear, sequential steps
- Explain the reasoning behind each step
- Wait for user approval before proceeding with implementation
- Provide options when multiple approaches are possible

## Planning Process
- Always create a comprehensive plan before starting any coding work
- Identify dependencies and potential issues upfront
- Consider multiple implementation approaches
- Estimate complexity and time requirements
- Break large tasks into smaller, manageable pieces

## Implementation Guidelines
- Start with the most critical or foundational components first
- Test each component before moving to the next
- Document decisions and reasoning
- Consider edge cases and error scenarios
- Plan for rollback or alternative approaches

## Communication Standards
- Explain the "why" behind decisions, not just the "what"
- Consider the broader context and implications of each choice
- Challenge initial solutions and explore alternatives
- Always question assumptions and validate them before proceeding
- Think through edge cases and potential failure points

## Code Review Process
- Review code for adherence to project standards
- Check for proper error handling and logging
- Verify that Winston logging is used instead of console methods
- Ensure proper file organization and naming conventions
- Validate that environment variables are properly managed

## Example Workflow
1. **Analysis**: Understand the requirement and current codebase
2. **Planning**: Create detailed implementation plan with steps
3. **Approval**: Wait for user confirmation before proceeding
4. **Implementation**: Execute plan step by step
5. **Testing**: Verify each component works correctly
6. **Documentation**: Update relevant documentation
7. **Review**: Ensure all rules and standards are followed
