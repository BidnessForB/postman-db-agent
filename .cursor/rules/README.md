# Cursor Rules Migration Summary

## Migration Completed
Successfully migrated from single `.cursorrules` file to modular `.cursor/rules/` structure.

## New Rules Structure (Streamlined)
```
.cursor/rules/
├── api-dependencies.mdc    # OpenAI API and package management (concise)
├── architecture.mdc        # Project structure and organization (condensed)
├── code-style.mdc         # Formatting, naming, and style guidelines (simplified)
├── environment.mdc         # Secrets management and configuration (minimal)
├── error-handling.mdc     # Error management patterns (reduced)
├── logging.mdc            # Winston logging framework rules (streamlined)
├── templating.mdc         # Handlebars and CSS rules (focused)
└── workflow.mdc           # Development workflow and planning (unchanged)
```

## Benefits Achieved
- **Modularity**: Each file focuses on a specific aspect of development
- **Maintainability**: Easier to update individual rule categories
- **Scoping**: Rules can be applied to specific directories or file patterns
- **Efficiency**: Cursor can process smaller, focused files faster
- **Team Collaboration**: Developers can focus on relevant rule files

## Rule Categories
- **Critical Priority**: workflow.mdc (development process requirements)
- **High Priority**: logging.mdc, architecture.mdc, code-style.mdc, environment.mdc, templating.mdc
- **Standard Priority**: api-dependencies.mdc, error-handling.mdc

## Migration Date
Created: $(date)

## Original File Status
- Original `.cursorrules` file preserved for reference
- No changes made to existing rules during migration
- All rules successfully extracted and organized

## Next Steps
1. Test new rules structure with Cursor AI
2. Verify all rules are being applied correctly
3. Consider removing old `.cursorrules` file after successful testing
4. Update team documentation about new rules structure
